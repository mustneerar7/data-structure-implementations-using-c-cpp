# Data structures Implementations using C/C++
This repository contains the implementations of 
some popular data structures both in `C++` and `Clang`.

The variants available in both C & C++ contain a `header` file contining Object Oriented code for the data structure while C versions contain procedural implementations.

### Uploaded Data structures
- `C/C++` Stack
- `C/C++` Queue
- `C++` Linked List
- `C++` Trees
