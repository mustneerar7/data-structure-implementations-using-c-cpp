# Data structures Implementations using C/C++
This repository contains the implementations of 
some popular data structures both in `C++` and `Clang`.
 
The C++ versions contain a `header` file contining Object Oriented code 
for the data structure while the C versions contain procedural implementations 
in regular C source files.

### Uploaded Data structures
